# Quantum Rebase

## Book Jacket
Alex Rector is a theoretical physicist at the Central Eurasian Ministry of Science. He always knew the Ministry's work with Quantum Entanglement was going to advance science beyond what he could imagine—he had no idea how right he was. Soon his team harnessed this technology to influence people's thoughts across nearly unlimited distance. They couldn't imagine a more powerful or dangerous piece of equipment than being able to plant ideas into a person's mind from the other side of the world. Everyone agreed, until Alex figured out how to influence people's thought in the past.

There is no greater power than the ability to rewrite the past. Alex wasn't the only person to figure that out. Eurasian dissidents soon made an important realization: loyalists can't be loyal to a government that never existed and they can't fight a revolution that never happened. Now it's up to Alex to figure out how to prevent changes to the timeline from causing a potentially universe imploding paradox and ultimately figure out what he's willing to sacrifice and what he needs to save.

### Prologue
## Year 2545
"Lisa, show me the New report. I need to know what's happening outside." said Alex as he sat on the floor of his lab in the Central Eurasian Ministry of Science. "Sure thing, Alex" replied Lisa, the AI lab assistant Alex had programmed in first few years at the Ministry. The hologram projector sparked to life projecting the slightly translucent, blue tinted image of a woman in her mid 20's. 

The woman looked to be of east asian, possibly Korean, descent. The countries that used to make up the continents of Europe and Asia had merged to form the Central Eurasian Union a few hundred years ago. Despite technically being a single country, most people referred to themselves by what their country used to be called. People living in London were just as British as ever and residents of the Seoul megatropolis still preferred to be called "Korean."

The hologram started to move after loading for a few seconds and her voice became audible. "This is Ann Choi with the EBC World Service. The Prime Minister has issued a State of Emergency this morning after rising tensions with the People's Republic of North America have lead to the arming of Nuclear Missiles in the provinces of Hawaii, New England, and Costa Rica. The parliament is attempting to resolve the issue diplomatically, but is urging all residents to prepare for evacuation to the nearest fallout shelter. Women and children under the age of 15 are being asked to start evacuation procedures immediately."

"That's enough Lisa. Turn it off." said Alex. "It's exactly what we saw coming. It's exactly what we were trying to prevent. I guess the Universe decided she had taken enough of my hubris."

### Chapter 1
A short, thin man in his 50's wearing grey flannel trousers and a plaid button-down shirt walked onto stage in front of a quiet audience of just over 6,000 scientists and journalists from around the globe. News cameras clicked on and the background music playing from the sound system faded down to an inaudible level before shutting off completely. As the man reached the podium in the centre of the stage, the small red LED on top of the microphone illuminated indicating it was live. "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 42nd annual Central Eurasian Ministry of Science expo." said the man. "Every year the opening night keynote holds exciting announcements of the Ministries latest projects and most thrilling discoveries, but this year we truly have something special for all of you. Please allow me to introduce the brightest physicists I've ever had the pleasure of working with, Dr. Alex Rector." The audience erupted in applause in anticipation of what wonders of science were about to be unveiled to them.

Ever sense the countries of Asia combined with the already existing European Union to for the Central Eurasian Union, much cultural focus has been put on the Ministry of Science and the advancement of technology in general. With promises of nearly unlimited funding, scientists and visionaries alike flocked to the newly formed Union with the hope of advancing their studies and making some kind of dent in the world. This promise of funding for research was a welcome change from the attitude of the only other large government left on Earth: the People's Republic of North America. Leaders, and by extension citizens, of the People's Republic were considerably more "conservative" than those of the CEU. They viewed advancement of science and technology as a "nice to have" rather than a necessity. There hope was that by nearly eliminating all funding of research, they could lower taxes and encourage research through private enterprise while still having more money to help end hunger and housing issues. While nobel in intention, most scientifically minded individuals saw this as short sighted since it essentially eliminated the kind of blue-sky research so often benefitted by public funding.

Blue-sky research was precisely the aim of the CEU's Ministry of Science. Their mission statement even included the phrase, "…to promote the advancement of Human knowledge and technology with the hope of improving life for all of the Universe's inhabitants, even if such technology is not a commercially viable product." Each year at the Ministry's expo, researchers unveiled and presented about their work in the past year. Scientists from around the world came to the expo to learn of other research being done in their fields and for the chance to work with and discuss ideas with some of the world's greatest minds. Many times research released at the expo, while not intended for a specific real-world application, was licensed by corporations for use in products the researcher's had never dreamed of. Despite the CEU's parliament meeting regularly each week, most considered this expo to be the *real* gathering of the leaders of the world. 

The Expo's chairman left the stage as Alex Rector walked up to the podium. Alex's first appearance at the expo was just five year prior, in 2539. That year he and his team made waves throughout the scientific community for their work with Quantum Entanglement. Quantum Entanglement, a form of quantum superposition, had been a well known property of quantum mechanics since the days of Einstein and Schrödinger. 

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, those studying the unique, counter-intuitive property figured out that two particles could become entangled after being in physical content with each other. Once entanglement was achieved, any measured state of one particle was reflected in the other. This was proved early on by simple experiments with entangled photons passings through polarizing filters. If each single, entangled photon is unpolarized, it consistently has a 50% chance of passing through a polarizing filter. However, once one of the members of an entangled pair passes through a polarizing filter, both photons become polarized. Further, they found this link to be unaffected by distance between the two particles. Despite having a good surface understanding of how Quantum Entanglement worked, harnessing it for use in technology or even understanding why it worked seemed to elude all.

This is what made Dr. Rector's presentation in 2539 so ground breaking. He walked onto stage that year, a total unknown in the community, holding a small black box the size of a briefcase. He sat the box down on a table next to a Laptop and connected the two devices via their fiber-optic ports. A projector then illuminated and showed live video of Alex's research assistant nearly 9700 kilometres away in a lab in Hong Kong. Alex than explained that the two identical looking briefcases were point-to-point wireless data transceivers with unlimited range, that operating via Quantum Entangled particles. "Next," he said, "I'm going to transmit a 1 Terabyte data file from my laptop right here in London to my assistant's laptop in Hong Kong." He continued, "I want you to notice two things: First, the overall bandwidth as evidenced by how quickly the transfer happens. Second, we have an accurate atomic clock both here and in Hong Kong. As soon as the first bit of information is sent, the time will displayed on the screen. When the first bit of information is received on the other end, the clock will display it's current time. So the difference between the two displayed times is equal to the time it took a single bit to travel 9700 kilometres."

At this point, the audience was interested, but still didn't think that a completely unknown factor, still fresh out of college, would have anything too world changing to present. That attitude lasted another few seconds. Alex turned to his computer and pressed the enter key. A rapidly moving progress bar appeared on the projector screen and completed in about 5 seconds. The progress bar disappeared and was replaced by several lines or large monospace font:

       File Size: 1TiB
    Elapsed Time: 4.9998000001 Seconds
       Baud Rate: 1.759 Tbps (1,801.493 Gbps)
        Bit Sent: 09:12:23.4756179377 UTC
    Bit Received: 09:12:23.4756179398 UTC

The audience sat silently processing what they had just seen.  Transfer speeds approaching 2 terabits per second weren't unheard of when the devices were connected using a fiber-optic link and cable wasn't more than about 2 meters long. Long distance communication, though, was much harder. Typically speed-of-light limitations, signal degradation, and packet loss resulted in transfer speeds an order of magnitude slower. However, this wasn't the truly impressive thing about Alex's blatantly understated demonstration. The two atomic clocks showed that the first bit traveled through the first transceiver, across the continents of Europe and Asia, and into the second transceiver in just 9.8 nanoseconds. A photon traveling at the speed of light in a vacuum would take 32 milliseconds to travel that distance – 3.3 million times slower than what just happened. This proved what many had conjectured for years: the state reflection of quantum entangled particles happened via a fabric unaffected by general relativity and the universal speed limit of 299.8 kilometres per millisecond.

After the audience sat quiet for a few seconds, stunned at the implications of this demonstration, they erupted into a tremendous applause. In the following two years, this technology was licensed by thousands of companies across the world and implemented into every technology imaginable. Everything from cell phones and portable computers to orbital satellites and exploratory deep-space craft. No longer did aerospace engineers need to worry about maintaining line-of-sight for communication via high-speed lasers or about providing ships with enough electrical power to communicate via transitional RF radios. A new age of unlimited range, unlimited bandwidth, low power communication was quickly ushered in and welcomed by everyone.

This year, in 2544, expectations for Alex's presentation were significantly higher than his first. Both he and his team have gotten the reputation of surfacing without much ado, making a world-altering announcement, then disappearing again for a few years. Like most introverted, analytically minded people Alex was far more interested in actually *doing* his research, than *announcing* it. Alex started his presentation: "Last time I was on stage here at the expo I presented technology I helped to develop which enabled instantaneous transmission of electron charge between two points. "
