# Quantum Rebase

## Book Jacket
Alex Rector is a theoretical physicist at the Central Eurasian Ministry of Science. He always knew the Ministry's work with Quantum Entanglement was going to advance science beyond what he could imagine—he had no idea how right he was. Soon his team harnessed this technology to influence people's thoughts across nearly unlimited distance. They couldn't imagine a more powerful or dangerous piece of equipment than being able to plant ideas into a person's mind from the other side of the world. Everyone agreed, until Alex figured out how to influence people's thought in the past.

There is no greater power than the ability to rewrite the past. Alex wasn't the only person to figure that out. Eurasian dissidents soon made an important realisation: loyalists can't be loyal to a government that never existed and they can't fight a revolution that never happened. Now it's up to Alex to figure out how to prevent changes to the timeline from causing a potentially universe imploding paradox and ultimately figure out what he's willing to sacrifice and what he needs to save.

### Prologue
## Year 2545
"Lisa, show me the New report. I need to know what's happening outside." said Alex as he sat on the floor of his lab in the Central Eurasian Ministry of Science. "Sure thing, Alex" replied Lisa, the AI lab assistant Alex had programmed in first few years at the Ministry. The hologram projector sparked to life projecting the slightly translucent, blue tinted image of a woman in her mid 20's. 

The woman looked to be of east asian, possibly Korean, descent. The countries that used to make up the continents of Europe and Asia had merged to form the Central Eurasian Union a few hundred years ago. Despite technically being a single country, most people referred to themselves by what their country used to be called. People living in London were just as British as ever and residents of the Seoul metropolis still preferred to be called "Korean."

The hologram started to move after loading for a few seconds and her voice became audible. "This is Ann Choi with the EBC World Service. The Prime Minister has issued a State of Emergency this morning after rising tensions with the People's Republic of North America have lead to the arming of Nuclear Missiles in the provinces of Hawaii, New England, and Costa Rica. The parliament is attempting to resolve the issue diplomatically, but is urging all residents to prepare for evacuation to the nearest fallout shelter. Women and children under the age of 15 are being asked to start evacuation procedures immediately."

"That's enough Lisa. Turn it off." said Alex. "It's exactly what we saw coming. It's exactly what we were trying to prevent. I guess the Universe decided she had taken enough of my hubris."

### Chapter 1
A short, thin man in his 50's wearing grey flannel trousers and a plaid button-down shirt walked onto stage in front of a quiet audience of just over 6,000 scientists and journalists from around the globe. News cameras clicked on and the background music playing from the sound system faded down to an inaudible level before shutting off completely. As the man reached the podium in the centre of the stage, the small red LED on top of the microphone illuminated indicating it was live. "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 42nd annual Central Eurasian Ministry of Science expo." said the man. "Every year the opening night keynote holds exciting announcements of the Ministries latest projects and most thrilling discoveries, but this year we truly have something special for all of you. Please allow me to introduce the brightest physicists I've ever had the pleasure of working with, Dr. Alex Rector." The audience erupted in applause in anticipation of what wonders of science were about to be unveiled to them.

Ever sense the countries of Asia combined with the already existing European Union to for the Central Eurasian Union, much cultural focus has been put on the Ministry of Science and the advancement of technology in general. With promises of nearly unlimited funding, scientists and visionaries alike flocked to the newly formed Union with the hope of advancing their studies and making some kind of dent in the world. This promise of funding for research was a welcome change from the attitude of the only other large government left on Earth: the People's Republic of North America. Leaders, and by extension citizens, of the People's Republic were considerably more "conservative" than those of the CEU. They viewed advancement of science and technology as a "nice to have" rather than a necessity. There hope was that by nearly eliminating all funding of research, they could lower taxes and encourage research through private enterprise while still having more money to help end hunger and housing issues. While nobel in intention, most scientifically minded individuals saw this as short sighted since it essentially eliminated the kind of blue-sky research so often benefitted by public funding.

Blue-sky research was precisely the aim of the CEU's Ministry of Science. Their mission statement even included the phrase, "…to promote the advancement of Human knowledge and technology with the hope of improving life for all of the Universe's inhabitants, even if such technology is not a commercially viable product." Each year at the Ministry's expo, researchers unveiled and presented about their work in the past year. Scientists from around the world came to the expo to learn of other research being done in their fields and for the chance to work with and discuss ideas with some of the world's greatest minds. Many times research released at the expo, while not intended for a specific real-world application, was licensed by corporations for use in products the researcher's had never dreamed of. Despite the CEU's parliament meeting regularly each week, most considered this expo to be the *real* gathering of the leaders of the world. 

The Expo's chairman left the stage as Alex Rector walked up to the podium. Alex was a tall, thin framed man who looked young for all that he had accompanied in his life. He had medium length dark brown hair neatly parted to one side and thick, square-rimmed glasses reminiscent of the hipster anti-movement in the 2010's. He wore a brown tweed jacket with leather elbow patches, navy blue trousers, a white oxford-cloth button down shirt, a navy-blue bow tie, and brown leather-soled bluchers. Alex had a special fondness for clothing that reminded him of the college professors of old. The tweed jacket in particular had become something of a trademark for Alex, wearing it anytime he had to make a public appearance. Alex's first appearance at the expo was just five year prior, in 2539. That year he and his team made waves throughout the scientific community for their work with Quantum Entanglement. Quantum Entanglement, a form of quantum superposition, had been a well known property of quantum mechanics since the days of Einstein and Schrödinger. 

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, those studying the unique, counter-intuitive property figured out that two particles could become entangled after being in physical content with each other. Once entanglement was achieved, any measured state of one particle was reflected in the other. This was proved early on by simple experiments with entangled photons passings through polarizing filters. If each single, entangled photon is unpolarized, it consistently has a 50% chance of passing through a polarizing filter. However, once one of the members of an entangled pair passes through a polarizing filter, both photons become polarized. Further, they found this link to be unaffected by distance between the two particles. Despite having a good surface understanding of how Quantum Entanglement worked, harnessing it for use in technology or even understanding why it worked seemed to elude all.

This is what made Dr. Rector's presentation in 2539 so ground breaking. He walked onto stage that year, a total unknown in the community, holding a small black box the size of a briefcase. He sat the box down on a table next to a Laptop and connected the two devices via their fiber-optic ports. A projector then illuminated and showed live video of Alex's research assistant nearly 9700 kilometres away in a lab in Hong Kong. Alex than explained that the two identical looking briefcases were point-to-point wireless data transceivers with unlimited range, that operating via Quantum Entangled particles. "Next," he said, "I'm going to transmit a 1 Terabyte data file from my laptop right here in London to my assistant's laptop in Hong Kong." He continued, "I want you to notice two things: First, the overall bandwidth as evidenced by how quickly the transfer happens. Second, we have an accurate atomic clock both here and in Hong Kong. As soon as the first bit of information is sent, the time will displayed on the screen. When the first bit of information is received on the other end, the clock will display it's current time. So the difference between the two displayed times is equal to the time it took a single bit to travel 9700 kilometres."

At this point, the audience was interested, but still didn't think that a completely unknown factor, still fresh out of college, would have anything too world changing to present. That attitude lasted another few seconds. Alex turned to his computer and pressed the enter key. A rapidly moving progress bar appeared on the projector screen and completed in about 5 seconds. The progress bar disappeared and was replaced by several lines or large monospace font:

       File Size: 1TiB
    Elapsed Time: 4.9998000001 Seconds
       Baud Rate: 1.759 Tbps (1,801.493 Gbps)
        Bit Sent: 09:12:23.4756179377 UTC
    Bit Received: 09:12:23.4756179398 UTC

The audience sat silently processing what they had just seen.  Transfer speeds approaching 2 terabits per second weren't unheard of when the devices were connected using a fiber-optic link and cable wasn't more than about 2 meters long. Long distance communication, though, was much harder. Typically speed-of-light limitations, signal degradation, and packet loss resulted in transfer speeds an order of magnitude slower. However, this wasn't the truly impressive thing about Alex's blatantly understated demonstration. The two atomic clocks showed that the first bit traveled through the first transceiver, across the continents of Europe and Asia, and into the second transceiver in just 9.8 nanoseconds. A photon traveling at the speed of light in a vacuum would take 32 milliseconds to travel that distance – 3.3 million times slower than what just happened. This proved what many had conjectured for years: the state reflection of quantum entangled particles happened via a fabric unaffected by general relativity and the universal speed limit of 299.8 kilometres per millisecond.

After the audience sat quiet for a few seconds, stunned at the implications of this demonstration, they erupted into a tremendous applause. In the following two years, this technology was licensed by thousands of companies across the world and implemented into every technology imaginable. Everything from cell phones and portable computers to orbital satellites and exploratory deep-space craft. No longer did aerospace engineers need to worry about maintaining line-of-sight for communication via high-speed lasers or about providing ships with enough electrical power to communicate via transitional RF radios. A new age of unlimited range, unlimited bandwidth, low power communication was quickly ushered in and welcomed by everyone.

His presentation in 2539 had won him the funding equivalent of Carte Blanche. This year, in 2544, expectations for Alex's presentation were significantly higher than his first. Both he and his team have gotten the reputation of surfacing without much ado, making a world-altering announcement, then disappearing again for a few years. Like most introverted, analytically minded people Alex was far more interested in actually *doing* his research, than *announcing* it. Alex started his presentation: 

> A few hundred years ago, in 2042, George Baumgärtner made history. He and his research partner, Sven Riese, were Physicists working out of a CERN laboratory in Geneva. On October 22, after years of studying the quantum foam that makes up our universe, they ripped a hole in the very fabric of space-time itself and injected synthetically produced exotic matter produced by the Large Hadron Collider. This is impressive for countless reasons, but mainly just because the LHC was actually working that day. I guess the mechanics do manage to get it up and running at least one day a year.

Knowing his jab at the Large Hadron Collider was good-natured, the audience chuckled. When it was initially built in 2011 the LHC seemed to have problems repeatedly – at one point breaking because a bird flying overhead dropped a Baguette into a cooling vent. This event had since become known as "The Death Star Incident."

> Particle collider reliability aside, the result of this experiment is forever recorded in history: Baumgärtner and Riese opened a wormhole about 0.5 millimetre across that existed stably for 3 seconds. Not long, but it was leap from anything previously recorded. During that 3 second window, they used a small laser to send a burst photons into the wormhole. As predicted, they instantly shot out the other side of the wormhole with equal velocity relative to the openings orientation. Since this breakthrough wormhole technology has improved significantly. Now we can accurately and safely send interstellar ships from Earth into the orbit of another planet in another galaxy.

The audience could tell Alex was getting excited about whatever it was he was about to announce. He started to lose some of the formality in his tone and his pace increased to the point where it seemed he was just talking to himself – just thinking out loud and allowing a few thousand people around him to glimpse what was going on inside his head. Those who worked with Alex were all too familiar with this pattern. He would be strangely silent for hours or days at a time, pondering a problem, working out equations, and modelling the universe inside his head. Then, when the last puzzle piece fell into place and he finally true grokked the problem domain and it's implications he would explode into a fury of words. As his brain processed and walked around the model inside his head, exploring all of it's implications, he seemed to vocalise every single brain wave in real time. Every thought and detail and equation. Hardly anyone would could keep up with him, most would just stop whatever it was they were doing and listen. Some kept a tape recorder ready so that they could go back later and study his words. In public, he managed to keep his pace down to a rate where a mortal could keep up, but only barely.

> What hasn't been developed, though, is precision in where exactly the other end of the wormhole opens. When the Central European Ministry of Aeronautics plans on putting a ship into orbit around another planet, say Gilese 581 g, the tolerance of the spacecraft's exit point is in the range of about ±500 metres. For something the size of a Prometheus-class carrier, a 1 kilometre tolerance is not a big deal. However, for my interests we need to do much, much better.

> Last time I was on stage here at the expo I presented technology I helped to develop which enabled instantaneous transmission of binary state between two points using quantum entangled electrons. While being instrumental to many of the communication technologies in use today, it has a major disadvantage. To perform the initial entanglement of the two particles they must be in physical contact with each other. This means that the particle, after it's entangled, must physically travel to it's new location. This isn't normally a big deal, but what if we wanted to communicate with something that we can't physically travel to? What can't we physically travel to, you might say? What about, say…the past? 

> For centuries historians have studied the past using records and artefacts excavated form the ground. Our understanding of history as recent as 1900 A.D. is flawed and incomplete. Before electronic records existed, humans didn't have a durable means of information storage. We had no concept of backup and archival. With the age of documentation beginning in the early 2000's and the popularisation of the internet, we think we understand what people's thoughts and feelings and motivations at various times were, but we don't really know. Without being there, how could we? At the same time though, we all know we can't go to the past. One of the few records we have left from pre-2000 is Einstein telling us that. Our or our technology's very presence in the past would certainly mess up the timeline, cause unresolvable paradoxes, and destroy the Earth if not the Universe in the process. The question is then: how can we observe the past as if we were there *without actually being there*? 

> Two years ago, I asked this very same question to a good friend of mine, Zoë Derrick. Zoë is a neuroscientist and without a doubt one of the most brilliant people I know. She, also intrigued by this question, had an idea. What if we were able to take someone in the audience of an important event – perhaps Adolf Hitler's storming of a Beer Hall on November 8, 1923 – and perform the neural equivalent of a wiretap? We already know their are specific passageways in the brain that carry raw optic and auditory information. If we could record the electrical impulses flowing across the neurones the make up these busses and then playback those impulses into someone else's brain in current day, we could in effect create a virtual world allowing us to see and feel the past with our own senses.

People in the audience sat forward, starting to connect the dots of what Alex was talking about. It was odd that he had so suddenly taken an interest in history. He had always been so focused on moving ahead and improving the future that he never stopped to contemplate the past – at least not to anyone's knowledge. But regardless of the quick shift in his research focus, they idea of watching the future unfold around you was fascinating.

> There's a certainly a few caveats to achieving this idea. Up until recently, at least. Since that conversation, I've been working on cooling those caveats. Firstly, how do we access the past? Many of you are probably familiar with my theory that a wormhole in process of forming the tunnel that connects the two endpoints, could be reflected off of something generating a large amount of electromagnetic energy – perhaps the sun. We tested this theory last year, with a surprising result. The wormhole did indeed bounce off of the sun and open near the entry point. In fact, in opened exactly on top of the wormhole's entry point *30 years in the past*. We were able to verify this result by tracking the path of the tunnel through the quantum foam using a device based off Baumgärtner's original schematics. We're still having some trouble controlling exactly what point in time the wormhole opens, but the equations are coming along.

The quick, matter-of-fact, plainness with which Alex spoke these last few sentences betrayed the incredibility of what he had just said. Everyone in the audience, less one person, was in a confused state of disbelief and shock. They wanted so badly to believe what he said, but time travel? How could they? It was he stuff of science-fiction, not physics. It don't make any sense. Time travel was the kind of fringe science myth that lost a person all respect in the community, not something someone as brilliant physicist like Rector would discuss, let alone claim to have *done*. Unless, of course, it was true. The sheer impossibility is the only thing that made it even slightly believable. The sole person who wasn't shocked by the statement was Zoë Derrick, the neuroscientist that Alex spoke with such fondness about. Zoë was one of the few people Alex truly admired, and one of the only that truly rivalled his intelligence. She, already knowing the details of the announcement as well as the aspects Alex was being less than truthful about, simply sat back into her chair and smiled. In the back of her mind she hoped he wouldn't get caught up in the moment and accidentally say too much.

> Caveat three: how do we wiretap a brain? This was Zoë's contribution to the project. She worked out that since the brain is so parallel and fault tolerant in everything it does, a few key neurones could be hot-swapped in the brain without affecting the function, memory, or general integrity of the brain itself. In fact, with the appropriate delivery mechanism, the recipient doesn't detect that anything has happened at all. Up until now, such a delivery mechanism didn't exist – we would've had to use laser surgery to physically replace the key neurones. Unless of course you had a wormhole that could be opened with such precision, that it could target a single neurone.

> We've created the technology to open just such a wormhole now exists. This time at the expo, I don't have a black box for you. I don't have a ready to buy product or even a specific product in mind. But I think that what I do have for you will exceed anyone's expectation of what I came here to talk about today.

The projector in the stage flickered to life and the lights in the room dimmed. "What you are about to see," said Alex "is a high-definition, full colour video with stereo audio. Nothing new. Except of course, it was recorded before the video camera was invented." At that instant, the screen came life with a video taken from 5 to 6 feet off the ground – the point of view of a man. The man was walking throughout a grassy field where the knee-high grass looked like it had never been mowed before. The sky was a brilliant bright blue with a few clouds visible. Trees in the distance were swaying in the wind, it looked like the was a stiff breeze in one consistent direction. The man was walking towards something no one in the audience had ever seen before. It was a wood framed monstrosity in the shape of what looked – sort of – like a bi-plane. Two equal size cloth wings displaying a definite aerofoil shape sat on top of each other with a few feet in between. In front of the wings was a large protrusion leading to a third wing, much smaller than the first. Behind the two main wings were two symmetrically placed propellors tied by belt and pulley to a single small engine.

After seeing this contraption for a few seconds, someone in the audience said audible, "It's the Wright Flyer!" This proclamation rebounded around the room as people realised what they were looking at. The story of the Wright brothers was commonly told along with a description of the plane the built – the first manmade object to achieve controlled, powered flight. No one was really sure, though, if the story was true. It was always assumed that over time the story was exaggerated and twisted. Since all photos and records of the plane's actual existence had long since been lost, no one had the ability to truly prove the story was fact.

The man in the video walked closer towards the biplane and circled around looking at various parts. He checked to make sure the control surfaces on the forward elevators were functioning properly along with the rudimentary warping system on main wings. Walking behind the craft, he looked closely at the two propellors tied together via a chain and sprocket to the small engine. Carefully, he inspected each propellor for cracks and imperfections. Not knowing how something he had carved himself out of a piece of giant spruce would react to being spun at a few hundred revolutions per minute, he wanted to make sure there were no signs of damage or weakness. He called out to his brother, "Wilbur, we're good to go." With some difficulty Orville crawled between the two wings into the centre of the craft. He laid on his stomach on top of the bottom wing in a harness connected to cables that manipulated the control surfaces of the craft. By leaning his body to one side or the other he could control the roll and yaw of the plane. Both the pitch of the forward elevator and the engine's throttle were controlled by levers directly in front of him.

"Starting the engine now, Orville." said Wilbur. The engine directly behind Orville sputtered to life with the distinctive sound of an early, badly tuned, piston driven, internal combustion engine. Everyone knew this sound from watching old movies – the few Hollywood World War II movies still existing from the 20th century were particularly popular, especially in Western Europe. Though never hearing one in real life, almost anyone could recognise the powerful roar of a World War II era piston driven aircraft. The sound of the engine on the Wright Brother plane sounded minuscule by comparison, but the percussion and timbre of the engine proved it's ancestry to the later, more powerful variants. The piston engine, more specifically fossil fuels, had long since been outlawed. The environmental damage from fossil fuel emissions nearly destroyed the planet along with humankind in the mid 21st century. Around this time, after decades of bickering between between scientific fact and massive governmental resistance to change, global laws were finally passed to severely limit carbon footprint. Gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, coal, and natural gas were all outlawed as sources of combustable fuel. Finally having their businesses economically threatened, large corporations stepped forward to develop cleaner technologies. Most of the world eventually settled on clean forms of electric power, coming from a combination of wind, solar, and increasingly nuclear fusion, to replace their once essential fossil fuels. If it wasn't for the advent of chlorophyl based power plants, the carbon in the atmosphere would still be at the dangerous levels it once was. 

Orville once more tested each of his controls, moving the elevators up and down, warping the wings left and right, finally throttling the now running engine up to it peak power output and back down to idle. Satisfied that everything was working as expected he gave an approving thumbs up to his brother who was now standing off to the side. Orville centred the controls and pushed the throttle all the way forward. Wilbur then pulled a lever to release a weight suspended from a tower at the end of the runway. The weight, connected by rope to the aircraft, started to fall dragging the plane along with it. The place accelerated quickly towards the end of the wooden runway, all the while getting lighter on its feet. Finally, just a few feet before the end, the plane lifted elegantly into the air and disconnected from the rope catapulting it along. 

Gradually it reached 10 feet off the ground and continued to climb. 20 feet. 25 feet. Finally at 30 feet the craft levelled off, struggling to propel it's immense mass any further into the air with just a 12 horsepower engine. Orville worked the controls to ensure the wings stayed level and the plane kept it's straight course. After just a few seconds with the engine quickly running out of power, Orville adjusted the controls to start his descent. Seemingly much more slowly than it's takeoff, the airspeed slowed and altitude decreased. Orville turned the value to cut fuel to the engine and stop the propellors rotation. Within just a few seconds, the plane touched the ground and skidded to a stop in the grassy field. Dirt and dust and grass flew into the air propelled by the inertia of the 300 kilogram machine.

Once he had come to a full stop, Orville looked around and crawled back out of the machine. Wilbur still running to catch up with him yelled out, "We've done it Orville! We've finally done it." Orville replied with excitement and adrenaline brimming in his voice, "Yes we have – and I feel like this is just the beginning."

The screen went black. The projector shut off and receded back into the floor. After a few seconds, Alex finally broke the silence that had fallen upon the audience.

> What you have just seen was indeed live video from the Wright brother first powered flight in 1903. Live video shot, not by a camera, but by the eyes and brain of Orville Wright himself. Zoë and I were able to use the techniques and technologies we've developed to replace a few parts of Orville's brain with neurones we had quantum entangled. The paired neurone remained here in the present. Then, using an advanced oscilloscope Zoë developed, we were able to record the visual and auditory signals of Orville Wright in real-time. Having recorded these brainwaves, it was a simple matter to process them in a way that mimics the brains sensory input centres and export it as a video. So in conclusion, present to you a work in progress: time travel is possible.

With this declaration, Alex turned and walked off the stage hoping to avoid all human contact and intent on disappearing as soon as possible. The presentation was essential, he knew that. If he avoided presenting his work at the expo any longer it would raise suspicion about his work. People, especially the parliament brass funding his project, would start to wonder what it was they were funnelling a billion credits per year into and what the result would be. At the same time, he knew that if he said too much or revealed the true power of their findings to anyone, his technology would find it's way into the wrong hands. Only Alex and Zoë knew the true nature of the monster they had created. They intended on keeping it that way.
